Scale Free Network

1. Six degrees of separation
	
	1. 1967, avg mail path: 5.5

	2. Watts and Strogatz: email avg path: 6.8

	3. Internet: 800000000 nodes, avg = 18.59


2. Small worlds

3. Hubs and connectors

4. The 80/20 Rule

5. Power-laws signal self-organization

6. The rich get richer

7. Robust Scale Free Network 

	Scale-Free network are extremely robust in case of random falures

	Network resilience 

		In random networks, some node failures can easily break a network into isolated, non-communicating frameworks

		We can remove 80% of all nodes, and the remaining 20% will still remain connected

		The key to this is the presence of hubs, removing nodes randomly is not likely to affect them, and they hold the NW

8. Vulnerable Scale Free Network

	Scale-Free NW are very vulnerable to targeted attacks and to cascading failures

9. Spreading Viruses and Innovation
