Social Network Analysis

1. What is social network analysis
	
	Def: Analysis of the structure of relationships between social entities

	     Precess of investigating social structures in network

	     SNA uses math concepts and graph theory

	     Consists of nodes and edges

	Why is it important

		Marketing

		Crime detection

		Detection of opidemics

		Relationships and reputation

2. Network elements

	1. Edge connection between 2 node

	2. Node

	3. Network structure: 

		Directed, undirected

	4. Degress

		1. Adjacency matrix

			Representing edges (who is adjacent to whom) as a matrix

		2. Indegree

		3. Outdegree

	5. Centrality 

		Identifies the most important node in a graph


3. Network properties and metrics

	How far apart are they

	Are some nodes more imporant due to their position in network?

		1. Degree: How many people can this person reach directly

		2. Betweenness: How likely is this person to be the most direct route between two people in the network
			 经过路径最多的点

		3. Closeness: How fast can this person reach everyone in the network 
			能够最快到达目标的点

4. Finding communities

	1. Def

		1. A community is a group of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of network 

		2. network divides naturally into groups of nodes with dense connections internally and sparser

		3. Overlapping is allowed

	2. What makes a community

		1. Mutuality of ties

		2. Frequency of ties among members

		3. Closeness or reachability of subgroup members 

	3. K-Cores

		Each node within a group is connected to at least k other nodes in the group
