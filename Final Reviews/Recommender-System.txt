Recommender-System

1. Motivation

	- Too much user generated content

	- Online stores with too much inventory

	- Too many types of ads

2. Purpose of Recommender System 

	To assist user to find what they want; help them make correct decisions according to needs, interests, and goals 

3. Classic Algorithms for Recommendation 

	1. Featrue based (content based)

		1. def: based on the commonalities among the items that user has rated before

		2. General Idea: Given a set of items that user has shown interests before or the preferences explicityly specified by user, find the most similar items that user might be interested in now

		3. Advantage:

			1. takes into account features of items, easy to explain why a certain item is recommeeded 

			2. Similarity of items can be processed offline in advance to save online computation time

			3. Recommendation right away based on explicit

		4. Limit:

			1. overspecialization

			2. Limited content analysis 

			3. No wisdom of the group 

	2. Collaborative filtering

		1. Def: based on ratings from other users 

		2. General idea:

			1. Recommendation from nearest neighbors -- thoes who share the most similar interests

		3. Algorithm 

			1. Use statistical method to derive predictions from like-minded users or from similar item 

			2. two kinds

				User-to-user
				item-to-item
		4. Advantages

			1. Content is irrelevant

			2. No tagging or specified user interests 

			3. Built in community for the User-to-User approach

			4. The most commonly adopted technique in commercial recommender system 

			5. The most studied technique in academic community 

		5. Limit:

			1. Lack of ratings

			2. Complexity of the correlation algorithms requires doffline calculation

			3. Users often do not rate the same item the same way if offered the chance to rate it again

	3. Hybrid

		Feature based + Collaborative filtering + Social

	4. Recommendations issue

		Trust issue

		Privacy issue
